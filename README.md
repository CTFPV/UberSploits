Are you tired of not seeing new DJI exploits, research or worthwhile tools? It is because the hardwork of people actually capable of producing new work just gets repacked into script kiddie packs like SuperPatcher. Support the OGs, not the cheap clones.

UberSploits is a payload delivery client for DJI's NFZ update system.

DJI thought they were cute and patched the firmware update system. Effectively killing Tar and Feather, DontForget and DUMLRacer. UberSploits brings all those bugs back to life.
